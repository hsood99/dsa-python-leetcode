# DSA & Python Learning Repository 🚀

Welcome to my comprehensive learning repository focused on **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and **Python** programming. This project is designed to consolidate all of my technical learning, problem-solving, and revision in one organized space.

---

## 📌 What You'll Find Here

- 📘 Topic-wise notes for Python and DSA fundamentals.
- 🧠 Problem-solving solutions organized by topic and difficulty (Easy / Medium / Hard).
- ✅ Well-structured directories for clean navigation and efficient revision.
- 🔁 Version-controlled notes and code to track progress over time using Git and GitHub.

## 🧭 How to Use This Repository

- Start with the `notes.md` file in the root folder for a roadmap and progress overview.
- Go inside each topic folder (e.g., `Arrays/`) to access:
  - Notes: `notes.md`
  - Problems & solutions: `solutions.py`
  - Overview: `README.md` (optional per folder)
- Explore `python_basics_and_advanced/` to revise or learn Python.

## 🧠 Problem Difficulty Labels

Each problem file will contain solutions labeled as:

- 🟢 Easy
- 🟡 Medium
- 🔴 Hard

These tags help identify problems for revision and tracking progress.
