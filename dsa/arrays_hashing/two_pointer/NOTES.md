# üß≠ Two Pointers: The Ultimate Visual Guide

This guide covers everything you need to master the **Two Pointers** technique in DSA and LeetCode interview prep. By the end, you'll be able to tackle any two-pointer problem with confidence.

## üß† What Is the Two Pointers Technique?

A method that uses **two indices (pointers)** to iterate through a data structure, usually:

* **From both ends**: (start and end)
* **From the same side**: one fast, one slow
* Often on **sorted data**

---

## üö¶ When to Use It?

* Finding pair(s) that match a condition
* Processing **sorted arrays** efficiently
* Shrinking search space from both sides
* Replacing **nested loops** to optimize time

---

## üß© Core Patterns & Examples

### 1. **Two Pointers from Both Ends**

Used when the array is **sorted** or when comparing both ends.

* **Example**: Two Sum II, Valid Palindrome

```text
[1, 2, 3, 4, 6], target = 6
 ^           ^
left       right
```

### 2. **Fast and Slow Pointer**

Used to modify in-place or find certain patterns.

* **Example**: Remove Duplicates, Move Zeroes

```text
[0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
     ^     ^
   slow   fast
```

### 3. **Window Expansion (Sliding Window)**

Used for substring/window-based problems.

* **Example**: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

```text
"abcabcbb"
 ^   ^
start end
```

### 4. **Partitioning and Swapping**

Used for in-place rearrangement.

* **Example**: Sort Colors, Move Zeroes

```text
[2,0,2,1,1,0] ‚Üí [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

## üßò Strategy Table

| Pattern           | Key Idea                      | Movement                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Two Sum (Sorted)  | Use left+right to find target | move inward                    |
| Valid Palindrome  | Check alphanumeric equality   | move inward                    |
| Remove Duplicates | In-place deduplication        | fast/slow pointers             |
| Container Water   | Track max area                | shrink shorter height side     |
| Trapping Water    | Use maxLeft and maxRight      | move pointer with lower height |

## üèÅ Final Tips

* Focus on pointer movement logic.
* Think: "Can I replace nested loops with 2 pointers?"
* Dry run on small inputs.
* Use visuals: draw boxes, ranges, or pointer movements.
