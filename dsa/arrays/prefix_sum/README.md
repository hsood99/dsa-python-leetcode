# 📁 Prefix Sum - Week 1 (DSA Notes)

Welcome to the **Prefix Sum** module of your DSA journey (Week 1: Arrays & Hashing).
This module covers one of the most versatile preprocessing techniques for array-based problems.

## 📚 How to Use

1. **Start with `notes.md`** – go through theory and examples.
2. **Follow linked LeetCode problems**.
3. **Practice 5–10 problems** and analyze time/space complexity.
4. **Bookmark important tricks**, especially prefix+hashmap and prefix+binary search.

## 🧩 Upcoming Connections

Prefix sums will be used in upcoming modules too:

* Sliding Window (Week 3)
* Binary Search & Recursion (Week 4)
* Trees & Graphs (Prefix DFS patterns) (Week 5)
* Dynamic Programming optimizations (Week 6)

---

## 💡 Tip

> Most prefix sum problems involve one of these: range queries, subarray counts, or cumulative behavior. Spot them early.
