# Branching and Merging Demo

This file demonstrates a simulated workflow involving feature branches and merging into the main branch.

Steps:
1. Clone the repository (if not already cloned):
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

2. Create a new branch for your feature or fix:
   git checkout -b feature/add-hello-message

3. Make changes to this file (e.g., add a line below):
   - Added a hello message for demo purposes.

4. Stage and commit the changes:
   git add demo/branch_demo.txt
   git commit -m "Add hello message in branch_demo.txt"

5. Push the branch to remote:
   git push origin feature/add-hello-message

6. Open a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub from `feature/add-hello-message` â†’ `main`.

7. After review, merge the PR via GitHub UI.

8. Delete the feature branch locally and remotely:
   git branch -d feature/add-hello-message
   git push origin --delete feature/add-hello-message

Notes:
- Always pull latest changes from `main` before creating a new branch.
- Keep commits clean and messages meaningful.
- Ensure PR reviews if collaborating with others.
