# üîç Git Internals - Deep Dive Notes

This document explains the underlying mechanisms of Git ‚Äî how it stores data, manages history, and performs operations. Understanding Git internals helps you debug complex issues and use Git more effectively.

---

## 1. Git Object Model

Git stores content as **objects** in a repository. There are four main object types:

- **Blob:** Stores file data (content only, no metadata)
- **Tree:** Stores directory listings (file names, modes, and references to blobs or other trees)
- **Commit:** Stores metadata for a commit (author, message, pointer to a tree, and parent commits)
- **Tag:** Stores references to objects with extra metadata (usually used for release tags)

All objects are identified by a SHA-1 hash of their content.

---

## 2. The Git Repository Structure

- `.git/objects/` ‚Üí Stores all Git objects (compressed and hashed)
- `.git/refs/` ‚Üí Stores references to branch heads, tags, and remotes
- `.git/HEAD` ‚Üí Points to the current branch or commit
- `.git/index` ‚Üí Staging area information (also called the cache)

---

## 3. How Git Tracks Changes

Git tracks **content**, not files.

- When you commit, Git creates a tree object representing the project state.
- Each commit points to one tree and parent commits (except the root commit).
- The commit history forms a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**.

---

## 4. The Role of the Index (Staging Area)

- The **index** is a binary file that stores a snapshot of your next commit.
- It acts as a buffer between your working directory and commit history.
- Changes are staged using:

```bash
git add <file>
```

---

## 5. Branches and HEAD

- **Branches** are simply pointers (refs) to commits.
- `HEAD` is a special reference pointing to the current branch or specific commit.
- Moving `HEAD` updates the working directory to match the pointed commit.

---

## 6. How Merging Works Internally

- Git finds the **merge base** (common ancestor) of two branches.
- Performs a **3-way merge** between:
  - Merge base
  - Tip of current branch
  - Tip of the branch being merged
- Conflicts are marked for manual resolution.

---

## 7. Understanding Refs and Reflog

- **Refs:** Human-readable names pointing to commits (branches, tags).
- **Reflog:** Local history of `HEAD` and branch tip movements. Helps recover lost work.

```bash
git reflog
```

---

## 8. Packfiles and Garbage Collection

- Git compresses many objects into **packfiles** to optimize storage and speed up transfers.
- **Garbage collection:**

```bash
git gc
```

- Removes unreachable or dangling objects.

---

## 9. Common Git Internals Commands

```bash
git cat-file -t <hash>       # Show object type
git cat-file -p <hash>       # Show object content
git rev-parse <ref>          # Resolve a ref to a full hash
git ls-tree <tree-ish>       # Show a tree's contents
git log --graph --oneline --all   # Visualize commit DAG
```

---

## 10. How Push and Fetch Work

- **Push:** Sends your commits to the remote:

```bash
git push origin main
```

- **Fetch:** Retrieves remote changes but doesn't merge:

```bash
git fetch origin
```

- **Pull:** Combines `fetch` + `merge` (or `rebase`)

```bash
git pull origin main
```

---

## 11. Summary of Key Concepts Discussed

- Git stores everything as **objects** identified by SHA-1 hashes.
- **Branches** are lightweight pointers to commits.
- The **index** stages changes before committing.
- Git performs **3-way merges** using common ancestors.
- **Packfiles** improve performance and reduce size.
- **Reflog** is a powerful recovery tool.
- Workflow rules (like PRs or branch protection) operate on top of Git, not within its internals.

Understanding these internals gives you an edge in using Git professionally and resolving complex problems.
